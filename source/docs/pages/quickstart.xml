        <h>1. Let JRat Watch Your Program Run</h>

        <p>
            If you're program runs in Java 5 or above, then this step is extremely easy.
            You simply need to add a single argument to the java command that launches
            your program.
        </p>

        <terminal>java <b>-javaagent:shiftone-jrat.jar</b> [your java ops] [main class]</terminal>

        <p>
            You want to excersize your programs functionality.
        </p>

        <p>
            Shut down your program (this is JRat's queue to write out what it saw).
        </p>

        <h>2. Look at the Results</h>

        <p>
            After you shut down your application, JRat will create data files that
            contain information about your program's execution. JRat puts these files
            in a subdirectory under the directory from which your program ran. This
            directory will be named something like "jrat.output/2007-08-30_AM-08-02-44".
        </p>

        <p>
            These data files are not human readable. They require the JRat Desktop to
            open and analyze them. The JRat Desktop is contained in the same jar file
            that was used in the first step.
        </p>

        <terminal>java -Xmx256M -jar shiftone-jrat.jar</terminal>

        <p>
            The JRat Desktop application will open, and you can use it to view the
            collected data. To do this, select File then Open from the menu. Navigate
            to the subdirectory of "jrat.output" and open a ".jrat" file.
