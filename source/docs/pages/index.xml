        <h>What is it?</h>
        <p>
        The Java Runtime Analysis Toolkit is a low overhead, easy to use, open source
        performance profiler for the Java platform. JRat monitors an application's
        execution and persists performance measurements.  This data can then be viewed
        and analyzed using the JRat Desktop, a Swing application.
